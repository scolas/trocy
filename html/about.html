       <h3>Trocy</h3>
       <p> Trocy is a student marketplace where students can provide services to one another, buy products with one another and to better the social
           experience at the student's university. Furthermore, students who needs to get rid of their books no longer have to throw them away
            but give them to a student who needs it. Students who needs help to get around the school now have access to students who are willing to
            share a ride. Sometime its hard for a student to find a job but with Trocy, students can work for each other. By creating a Trocy environment, we help build
            a Trocy community that will have all the students enjoy their time in their schools. </p>
