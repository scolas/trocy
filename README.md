Trocy is a student marketplace company where students will sell their products, and provide services like carpooling, doing hair, tutoring and even cleaning. Also, students will be able to be more active on campus by having radio shows, tv shows, create cleaning services through Trocy. As a result, we are creating a Trocy Community to make life simple in universities community. Our goal is to have a functioning website and a functioning app both in IOS and android by August 21.  So far we have a prototype website on wix that will be the defining guidelines of how the app will look like and how the website will look like. The link to the website and a powerpoint of what we are doing are below.
